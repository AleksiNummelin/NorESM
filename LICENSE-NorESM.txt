SOFTWARE LICENCE AGREEMENT NorESM 
(version 1.0, 1 Sept. 2014)

NorESM OWNER,
currently represented through:
1. Univ. of Bergen, Geophysical Institute, Bergen (UiB) 
2. Uni Klima, UNI Research AS, Bergen (UniKlima)
3. Nansen Environmental and Remote Sensing Centre, Bergen (NERSC)
4. Norwegian Meteorological Institute, Oslo (MetNo)

The NORESM OWNER is developing and providing the Earth system model NorESM (Norwegian Earth System Model) which, at present based on:
-	The Community Earth System Modelling (CESM) and Community Climate System Model (CCSM) frameworks, originally developed at various universities and and research institutions in USA, with the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) as a hub.
-	Atmosphere model CAM, versions originally developed for the CESM version released in July 2011 (for NorESM1_ME) and for the CCSM released in April 2011 (for NorESM1_M)  in USA, modified by University of Oslo and the Norwegian Meteorological Institute (and others through co-operation, such as, e.g.,  University of Stockholm and University of Helsinki) to arrive at CAM4-OSLO
-	Land surface and land biogeochemistry model CLM, originally developed for CESM/CCSM in USA
-	Ocean physics model BLOM, originally developed at University of Miami, USA, with modifications carried out at NERSC, University of Bergen, and UniResearch AS
-	Sea ice model CICE, originally developed for CESM/CCSM in USA, with modifications the Norwegian Meteorological Institute and University of Bergen. 
-	Ocean biogeochemistry model HAMOCC, originally developed at Max Planck Institute for Meteorology, Germany, adopted for isopycnic coordinates by University of Bergen and UniResearch AS

The NorESM OWNER is committed to share NorESM with the scientific community and to make it available for scientific as well as educational purposes. As the major model components are is based on modules developed by others NORESM OWNER, the interests of these other originators have to be protected.

Users of NorESM must register with CESM through the NCAR web-page (http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/register/register_cesm.cgi) and preferably with working groups which are appropriate for their research and application interests. 

Further, users of HAMOCC must sign the license agreement for use of the MPI-ESM (which includes HAMOCC) Max Planck Institute of Meteorology (HAMOCC) as our isopycnic version of HAMOCC is based on the Max Planck code originally. (The signing can be done easily through the internet, see: http://www.mpimet.mpg.de/en/science/models/model-distribution.html).  
This license agreement addresses only those parts of NorESM which have been developed by NorESM OWNER.

NorESM software must remain controllable and documented. Feedback to the model developers is needed in order to report errors and to ensure scientific as well as technological progress of the model code. 

NorESM software must be protected from misuse and false statements about its formulation and performance. For this reason, all changes to the NorESM software must be marked clearly in the code and any publication of results based on modified NorESM versions must include a documentation of the changes made. As a main rule extensions should be reported to the NorESM OWNER. 

Unless it is a result of a well-defined co-operation, the use of the model and changes of the model code is on the responsibility of the user only. Extensions must be reflected in the code name referred to in publications and presentations and be distinct from the original code name. The reference to the name NorESM - with original version number - implies the use of the original model code only, as documented in existing publication.
This is a licence to use the NorESM-software for not-for-profit scientific and educational purposes only. 

This licence agreement is a personal licence. Usually groups of several users run an Earth system model. Each person of such a group using NorESM needs to sign a separate license, so that it is guaranteed that each individual user has read and accepted the terms of the licence agreement. This also allows communication with users if needed.  




Items of Agreement


1. Licence
This is a licence to use the NorESM-Software. The NorESM-Software, which is received with and accompanied by this licence agreement, is licenced (and not sold) to you on a personal non-exclusive basis by NORESM OWNER. You as well as your employer have to accept the terms of this agreement.

2. Definition of NorESM-Software
The term NorESM-Software includes all source codes, executable programs, documentation, run scripts, and data files of NorESM-Software. In this licence agreement, NorESM-software also includes model versions of NorESM1_M and NorESM1_ME and further dedicated software for analysis and/or analysis packages. 

3. Permitted Use 
Use of the NorESM-Software is permitted only for lawful not-for-profit scientific purposes in research and education. It is explicitly prohibited to use NorESM-Software or any parts of it, regardless of modified or not, for any commercial purposes. The license is limited to a period of 5 years and can be extended upon request.

4. Copyright and Distribution
The NorESM software is developed by NorESM OWNER and is the sole and exclusive property of NorESM OWNER. Parts of the software that have been developed at other institutions are subject to respective licence agreements of these institutions which need to be arranged for with these institutions. For NorESM, this is the case for CESM (NCAR and all CESM contributors) and Max Planck Institute of Meteorology (HAMOCC). 

You are allowed to make personal copies of the NorESM-Software and to modify it, run it, or recompile the code on any computer system., where you have legal access.

If you make copies of NorESM-Software, each copy must include all copyright information and notes that accompany the original. Such notes shall be displayed on any documents, media, printouts, and visualization or on any other electronic or tangible expressions associated with, related to or derived from NorESM-Software or associated documentation. The name of the amended code as referred to in publications and presentation, must clearly identify that the new code as distinct from the original version. The naming should be agreed with NORESM OWNER.

You are not allowed to sell, lend or in any other way make the NorESM-Software or any part of it available to third parties for monetary compensation. 

You are not allowed to distribute the NorESM-Software in its original or modified form. Third party users must obtain the NorESM-Software directly from NORESM OWNER. Exception: You are granted the right to share the NorESM-Software with colleagues from your institution, provided that these colleagues read, accept, and sign this licence agreement.

Under the definition of permitted use you may distribute your modifications to the
NorESM-Software provided that you adhere to the rules concerning modifications as outlined below in section 5. You are not allowed to sell modifications to this NorESM-Software, but you may ask for reimbursement of the cost directly related to  the re-distribution.


5. Modifications
Modifications are supplements to the NorESM-Software, which other users can apply to the original NorESM-Software from NorESM OWNERNORESM OWNER. Modifications may include revised versions of subroutines or modules, but must not constitute a working model on their own.

You may change any part of the source code, run scripts, or data files, provided that all files that are modified carry a prominent notice indicating the name of the person who changed the file, the modification date, and the purpose of the modification.
Results (data files and plots or visualization products) obtained with modified versions of the NorESM-Software must bear a clearly visible label, which distinguishes such product from any product obtained with the original version of the NorESM-Software, unless you guarantee that the results are - in fact - identical.

Error fixes and modifications of the NorESM-Software shall  be communicated to the NORESM OWNER (represented by the core NorESM model development group, or a delegated member of this group) so that they can be used to improve the NorESM-Software. This does not affect your right to distribute such modifications as outlined above. You agree to submit a copy of all modified parts of the NorESM-Software to NORESM OWNER. This covers all modifications, which maintain the functionality of the NorESM-Software as provided, and those modifications, which improve the model results and/or performance.
