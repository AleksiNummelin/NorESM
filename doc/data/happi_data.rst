HAPPI data
=============

Large ensemble experiments (125 members) were carried out with NorESM1-Happi (Graff et al., 2019) for 

   - the present-day climate (the All-Hist experiment), 
   - a climate that is 1.5 degrees warmer than pre-industrial conditions (the Plus15-Future experiment), and 
   - a climate that is 2.0 degrees warmer than the pre-industrial (the Plus20-Future experiments) 

as a part of the HAPPI initiative (Half A degree additional warming, Prognosis and Projected Impacts; happimip.org; Mitchell et al., 2017).
