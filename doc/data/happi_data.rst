1.5 and 2.0 degree warming experiments 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

AMIP-style HAPPI experiments
++++++++++++++++

A set of AMIP-style large ensemble experiments (125 members) were carried out with NorESM1-Happi (Graff et al., 2019) for three climate states: 

   - the present-day climate (the All-Hist experiment), 
   - a climate that is 1.5 degrees warmer than pre-industrial conditions (the Plus15-Future experiment), and 
   - a climate that is 2.0 degrees warmer than the pre-industrial (the Plus20-Future experiments) 

as a part of the HAPPI initiative (Half A degree additional warming, Prognosis and Projected Impacts; happimip.org; Mitchell et al., 2017).

CMIP5 DECK and scenario experiments with NorESM1-Happi
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A set of DECK experiments and scenario experiments were carried out with NorESM1-Happi (Graff et al., 2019) to enable an extensive validation of the model in line with the CMIP5 protocol (note that these experiments are not a part of the official CMIP5 data set):

   - a pre-industrial control simulation (the **piControl** experiment)
   - three historical members for the time period 1850-2005 (the **Hist1**, **Hist2**, and **Hist3** experiments)
   - Hist1 with external forcings as in 1850, but with with varying (historical)
   
      - greenhouse gases (the **GHG only** experiment)
      - aerosols and aerosol precursor emissions (the **Aerosol only** experiment)
      - natural solar radiation and vulcanos (the **Natural only** experiment)
   - RCP scenario experiments in which the radiative forcing at the end of the 21st century corresponds to
   
   - 2.6 W/m\ :sup:`2`\  (the **RCP2.6** experiment)
   
      - 4.5 W/m\ :sup:`2`\  (the **RCP4.5** experiment)
      - 8.5 W/m\ :sup:`2`\  (the **RCP8.5** experiment)
   - experiments in forcings are as in the pre-industrial climate except the CO\ :sub:`2`\   concentrations which are
   
   - instantly quadroupled at the beginning of the experiment (the **abrupt-4xCO**\ :sub:`2`\ experiment)
   
      - increased by 1% per year untill quadroupling and then held constant (the **gradual-4xCO**\ :sub:`2`\   experiment)

**The data (raw model output) can be retrieved from the NIRD research data archive: https://doi.org/10.11582/2020.00021**
