Welcome to the NorESM2 User's Guide!
================================================

The purpose of the NorESM2 User's Guide is to provide a common place for NorESM2 users and developers to share information. E.g. How is the code organised? What tools are used? Which version should be run for what purpose? 


This is the NorESM2 documentation which is currently being re-organized, under revision.

| The NorESM1 version ReadTheDocs can be found here
| https://noresm-docs.readthedocs.io/en/noresm1/

If you have any questions or interested in actively participate in the reorganization, create a new issue on github at https://github.com/NorESMhub/NorESM/issues
