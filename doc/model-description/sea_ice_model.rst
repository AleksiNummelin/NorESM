.. _cea_ice_model:

The sea-ice model, CICE
======================

The sea ice model component is based upon version 5.1.2 of the CICE sea ice model of Hunke et al. (2015). A NorESM2-specific change is including the effect of wind drift of snow into ocean following Lecomte et al. (2013), as described in Bentsenet al. (in prep).
