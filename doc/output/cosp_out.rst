COSP output
''''''''''

The CFMIP Observation Simulator Package (COSP) is an integrated part of the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM) and hence NorESM2. COSP calculates model cloud diagnostics that can be directly compared with satellite observations from ISCCP, CloudSat, CALIOP, MISR, and MODIS. 

Taking out COSP data, the following 57 output variables (of which 7
are 4 D) are added to the output (+ ca. 10% CPU-time): :ref:`cosp_extra_output`

For a description on how to configure NorESM2 with COSP, please see :ref:`configurations/experiment_environment`
